# Fix template literal expressions by wrapping numbers in String()

# This script uses sed to fix template literal expressions
# Pattern: ${variable} where variable is a number type -> ${String(variable)}

echo "Fixing template literal expressions..."

# Note: This is a simplified approach. Manual review recommended.
# The actual fixes need to be done carefully based on context.

echo "Please run eslint with --fix and then manually fix remaining issues"
echo "Remaining issues require context-aware fixes"
